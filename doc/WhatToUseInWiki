* LaTeX commands are ok and are passed through largely unchanged 

* A lot of effort is made to convert Wiki syntax to LaTeX syntax as much as possible. However, nothing is perfect, so there might be pitfalls. In particular, you can use: 
   * Headline commands; they are translated into corresponding sectioning commands 
      * Some guesses are made to generate label commands 
   * Figure inclusion 
   * Tables 


* Caveats: 
   * Underscores _ need special treatment. They should not appear in \cite{} commands or \ref{} commands
