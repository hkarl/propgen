Let us assume you have followed the install instructions. Now you are ready to setup a new project. Follow these steps: 

* Create a suitable Wiki Web. That highly depends on which wiki you use and where it is hosted. 

* Look into the templates directory and the sub-directory corresponding to your wiki type. There is a file called project (whith extensions like .twiki). Create a wiki page under a suitable name and upload the content of this file there. The name of this wiki page is the anchor to link the wiki to the scripts used here. 

* Put the base URL of your and the name of your project start Wiki page in the settings.cfg file (it is in the main directory). It goes in the section [Wiki], into the two settings baseURL and projectPage. 
  Example: 
   * Suppose you can look at your main Wiki page at the URL
     https://twiki.wikihoster.com/bin/view/OurProject/ProjectRoot 
   * Then set as follows: 
     wikitype = twiki
     baseURL = https://twiki.wikihoster.com/bin/view/OurProject/
     projectPage = ProjectRoot 
  Note: Watch the trailing / in baseURL! 

* In the same [Wiki] section of settings.cfg, you need to set up the other flags as well. (Should be self-explanatory)
