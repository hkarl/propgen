Wiki
====
.. program::  Wiki

See LICENCE file for licencing information! 
Set up the necessary information to access the  wiki: which type, 
where can it be found, what is the start page, which account and password 
to use to log in. 


.. describe:: projectName

    This option specificies the root Wiki page where the main project information can 
    be found. It also serves as the filename of the final pdf file. 

    Default:   TestProject 

.. describe:: wikitype

    The wikitype setting selects which type of wiki access is to be
    used. Wikitypes currently supported are: twiki, moinmoin and moinmoin-local
    
    Option 1: moinmoin-local
    This option specifies that the a moinmoin wiki can be accessed in
    the same file system where the generation system executes. This
    option requires to sepcify the moinmoinpath option as well. No user
    and password need to be given, but the files must be accessible for
    reading. 
    
    Option 2: moinmoin 
    
    A moinmoin wiki is used and accessed remotely, using the mechanize
    library. To this end, both the wikiuser and wikipassword option need
    to be specified; they are used for login. Also, the baseURL option
    needs to be specified: it provides a URL where the wiki can be
    accessed, without any concrete page name. Example: 
    
    baseURL = http://hk-vm.cs.uni-paderborn.de:8080/
    
    Option 3: twiki
    
    It needs the same options as moinmoin as well as the loginURL
    setting. The difference is that the obtained files are parsed
    assuming the twiki syntax and the login process to a Twiki is
    slightly different from a moinmoin wiki.
    The distribution's configuration file example assumes a moinmoin-local 

    Default:   moinmoin-local

.. describe:: moinmoinpath

    Specify the moinmoin path in the standard PropGen distribution. This
    option is only relevant if wikitype = moinmoin-local and can be left
    out for other wiki types. 

    Default:   ../moin/

.. describe:: baseURL

    For remote access to a wiki. It specifies the "root" URL where the
    wiki can be accessed, without any particular page name. It is ignored for the moinmoin-local
    wikitype and only used for other wikitypes. 

    Default:   http://hk-vm.cs.uni-paderborn.de:8080/

.. describe:: wikiuser

    The wikiuser account name to use to log in. Ignored in the
    moinmoin-local wikitype. The default corresponds to the account name
    preset in the distribution's moinmoin wiki. Change this option to
    reflect your own user name. 

    Default:   ProjectMaster

.. describe:: wikipassword

    Password used to log in. The default is the one used in the
    distribution's example moinmoin wiki. You definitely want to change
    the password on the wiki and then reflect this change here. It is ignored in the
    moinmoin-local wikitype and only needed for remote access. 

    Default:   123abc

.. describe:: loginURL

    Some remote wikis usually need a special login URL, e.g., Twiki
    wikis. Specify here. This setting is ignored in both the
    moinmoin-local wikitype (where no login is needed at all) and in the
    moinmoin wikitype (were the login URL is constructed directly from
    the baseURL and no separate URL is needed). 

    Default:   https://twiki.sics.se/bin/login

.. describe:: httpProxyIP

    For remote Wiki access through a proxy: These variables are used by
    the mechanize module, for access via an HTTP or HTTPS proxy. You can
    specify the proxy's IP, port number, and user and password, if
    needed. You can do that separately for HTTP and HTTPS access.  But
    this does not always works out well.  Also, this functionality is
    not well tested. Your mileage WILL vary! All the defaults are just
    empty. 

    Default:   

.. describe:: httpProxyport

    
    Default:

PathNames
=========
.. program::  PathNames

The section PathNames gives fine-grained controled over the
dictionaries where intermediate files are stored. 
Caution: best not to touch these paths!!! You should know what you
are doing here! 
Note: these paths are relative to the main directory


.. describe:: binpath

    Where are all the scripts for the actual generation? 

    Default:   bin 

.. describe:: wikipath

    Where should downloaded wiki files be stored? 

    Default:   generated/wiki 

.. describe:: wikiwppath

    
    Default:   generated/wiki/wp

    Default:   generated/xml/wp

.. describe:: latexTemplates

    Where is the LaTeX templates file? 

    Default:   template/latexTemplates.cfg

.. describe:: genlatexpath

    Where do generated LaTeX files, wp paths, partner files go? 

    Default:   generated/latex

.. describe:: genlatexfigurespath

.. describe:: genlatexpartnerspath

    
    Default:   generated/latex/partners

.. describe:: manuallatexpath

    Where are the MANUAL latex files? 
    Usage: in that directory, no files are EVER overwritten (as opposed
    to the genlatex directory tree, where all files are routinely
    overwritten). 
    However, it is ensured that for all generated files, 
    there is either a regular file of the same name in the manual directory
    (then nothing happens), or a symbolic link is created in the manual directory. 
    NOTE: no good idea how to replicate that behavior in Windows

    Default:   latex

Gantts
======
.. program::  Gantts

Control which and how Gantt charts are typeset. This section has a
few True/False toggles to include/exclude some features in the
charts. It also has a few parameters detailing layout options. 
For fine-grained control, see the latexTemplates.cfg file; in
particular, the GanttPrefix section. Also, the true/false settings
here can be easily used (via the LaTeX ifthenelse command) to
control behavior in latexTemplates.cfg.  


.. describe:: WpMilestonesUncompressedShow

    Some simple examples - generate various WP-specific Gantt charts for
    milestones, deliverables. 

    Default:   True       	     

.. describe:: WpMilestonesShow

    
    Default:   True       	     

.. describe:: WpDeliverablesUncompressedShow

    
    Default:   True       	     

.. describe:: ShowWPBar

    For the full-project milestones/deliverable gantt charts: build a WP bar to separate WPs ? 

    Default:   True 	     

.. describe:: ganttPerWPShowsLegend

    should the WP-specifc Gantt charts show a legend? 

    Default:   True 

.. describe:: ganttLegendTwoColumn

    Should a Gantt legend be one or two columns? (A one-column legend
    will consume a lot of space) 

    Default:   True

.. describe:: ganttTaskbarsShowTaskname

    Task bars show task names in the gantt chart? 
    If True, the Gantt chart is likely easier to read, but the task name
    will typically extend outside of the taskbar. If False, the taskname
    should probably appear in the legend of a Gantt chart, else hard to
    figure out just from the task ID (Gantt chart taskbar will show task
    ID like T 1.2, using the standard templates). 

    Default:   True 

.. describe:: ganttDistanceBetweenMS

    A compact layout of a Gantt chart requires that deliverables and
    milestones are set on the same line (else, every
    milestone/deliverable marker on separate line will create very long
    Gantt charts). This setting controls how many month a marker
    "occupies", how much space it needs before another marker can be set
    on the same line. Minimum value is 1, for the marker itself. Set it
    to a larger value to have each marker on its own line. 

    Default:   4  

.. describe:: milestoneDecoration = fill=orange, rounded corners

    How should a milestone look like? Put a "decoration string"
    according to the pdfgantt package here. (Use the GanttPrefix if you
    want to change the look of a deliverable marker). 

    Default:  5pt

.. describe:: milestonesShowCrossWP

    Show cross-WP milestones? That means: Each milestone has a "home"
    workpackage where it is defined. But it can have contributing tasks
    from other WPs as well (called a "cross-WP" milestone). Should the
    milestone appear also in those "contributing WP"'s Gantt charts? (it
    will always appear in its home WP's Gantt chart)

    Default:   True  

.. describe:: deliverablesShowCrossWP

    Same thing: show cross-WP deliverables? 

    Default:   True 

.. describe:: milestoneLegendTemplate

    Template to format the milestone legends in the Gantt charts. The
    useful when the legends are typeset using a itemize-like list. This
    setting will generate the milestoneGanttLegend (or
    deliverableGanttLegend); it is more a convenience function and could
    also be done in latexTemplates, but would be a little cumbersome
    there). 
    
    A plausible alternative for the legend strings is to use a description 
    environment instead. That requires then a corresponding change in 
    latexTemplates.cfg. Not difficult to do, look for compactitem there. 

    Default:   \item \textbf{${id}}: ${Title} 

.. describe:: deliverableLegendTemplate

    See milestoneLegendTemplate for details. 

    Default:   \item \textbf{${id}}: ${Title}

    Default:   True

.. describe:: showEffortPartnerTasks

    One table showing effort per partner and task, over all tasks 

    Default:   True 

.. describe:: piePMsWPs

    A pie chart, showing person month summaries for WPs

.. describe:: piePMsPartners

    A pie chart, showing person month summaries for each partner  

    Default:   True 

.. describe:: piePMsPartnerTypes

    A pie chart, showing person month summaries for each partner type (industry, SME, academic)  

    Default:   True 

.. describe:: piePMsNations

    A pie chart, showing person month summaries for each nation   

    Default:   True 

.. index::
   single:  settings.cfg ;  WPTables

WPTables
========
.. program::  WPTables

This section collexts all information that is relevant for the
actual workpackage tables. 


.. describe:: maxPartnersPerRow

    How many partners should be typeset in one row of the WP tables? 
    The choice depends mostly on how long the partner shortnames are; 8
    seems to be a good compromise between readability and space
    effiency.  

    Default:   8			

.. describe:: firstColumnWidth

    How wide should the first column be? 
    Give the value as percent of textwidth! 

    Default:   15

.. describe:: wptablespacing

    How to influence the spacing of the wp tables? 

    Default:   @{\hskip 0ex}

.. describe:: tabularCorrection

    Correction factor to eadjust total width of the WP tabular. This
    does require some fiddling if any of the above values is changed.  
    (Note: I'd much appreciate help from a LaTeX wizard to ensure a tabular 
    environment is EXACTLY textwidth wide) 

    Default:   0.95 

.. describe:: tasklistShowsDuration

    The WP forms has a section with a list of all the tasks. Should
    this list show the duration of a task?  (Details can be fixed in
    latexTemplates.cfg, section WpTasks 

    Default:   True 

.. describe:: tasklistShowsPartners

    Should it show which partners contribute to the task? 

    Default:   True 

.. describe:: tasklistShowsDeliverables

    Should it show the deliverables to which this task contributes? 

    Default:   True 

.. describe:: tasklistShowsMilestones

    And the milestones? 

    Default:   True 

.. describe:: wpdescriptionShowsLeader

    The box "Description of Workpackage" - should it show the WP Leader? 

    Default:   True 

.. describe:: taskboxShowsLeader

    Apart from the WP description, each task has an invidual box. 
    How much details should they report? 
    (this is used in latexTemplates.cfg in the WpTasksDescriptions
    section)
    Should it show the Leader of the particular task? 

    Default:   True

.. describe:: taskboxShowsObjectives

    Should it show the objectives of the task? (If this is False, this
    information does not appear anywhere.) 

    Default:   True

.. describe:: taskboxShowsDescription

    Should it show the description of the task? (If this is False, this
    information does not appear anywhere.) 

    Default:   True

.. describe:: taskboxShowsDeliverables

    Should it list the Deliverables contributed by each task? The
    standard template typesets this as a table at the end of each
    taskbox; easy to change in the WpTasksDescriptions section of
    latexTemplates.cfg 

    Default:   True

.. describe:: taskboxShowsMilestones

    And correspondingly the milestones? 

    Default:   True

.. describe:: taskboxShowsPartners

    And that taskbox can show the partners active in this task. 

    Default:   True

.. describe:: deliverablesWPshowDue

    Each workpackage has a list of deliverables it produces (only the
    "own" deliverables are relevant here). This list can contain several
    information; here, the Due date can be turned on or off. These
    settings are used in WpDeliverables in latexTemplates.cfg. 

    Default:   True

.. describe:: deliverablesWPshowTasks

    Should the deliverable list show which tasks contribute to a
    particular deliverable. 

    Default:   True

.. describe:: deliverablesWPshowPartners

    Similarly, which partners contribute to the deliverable? 

    Default:   True

.. describe:: deliverablesWPshowDescription

    And finally, a deliverable can have a description. Should it be
    shown? (If this option is False, the deliverable description does
    not appear anywhere, when using the standard templates). 

    Default:   True

.. describe:: milestonesWPshowTasks

    Similar to the deliverables, a list of milestones per WP can be
    controlled. See the WpMilestones section in latexTemplates.cfg for
    details. 

    Default:   True

.. describe:: milestonesWPshowPartners

    
    Default:   True

    Default:   True 

.. index::
   single:  settings.cfg ;  LaTeX

LaTeX
=====
.. program::  LaTeX

The LaTeX section coleects options controlling LaTeX
processing. These are simle True/False flags to turn on/off various
parts of the proposal.  
NOTE: these settings are only processed in the makefile; changing them 
and directly running pdflatx will have no effect. 


.. describe:: showCommissionHints

    Should the PDF file include the commission hints text? (as defined
    on the wiki by the commissionhint level 5 headings on the wiki
    pages). It is HIGHLY recommended to turn this off before producing
    the final version of the proposal. 

    Default:   True 

.. describe:: useShowkeys

    Should the showkey package be used, highlighting the label, ref and
    cite commands?  This can be useful to have an idea which labels
    exist for cross-referencing and looking for errors. Turn this off
    for the final version. 

    Default:   False 

.. describe:: showWarnings

    Should warnings and fixmes be printed? This includes the list in
    warnings.tex. Turn this off for the final version. 

    Default:   True 

.. describe:: showListOfTables

    Should the table of content show list of tables? 

    Default:   True 

.. describe:: showListOfFigures

    Shoudl the table of content show list of figures? 

    Default:   True 

.. describe:: showAcronymList

    Should there be a list of acronyms? main.tex include a file
    AcronymsList.tex. Your choice how to fill this list. NOTE:
    AcronymsList.tex is not included in the default distribution. Just
    setting this flag to True will result in an error.

    Default:   False 

.. describe:: useMultipageDeliverableTable

    Should the deliverable and milestone collection table be typeset
    using a standard tabular environment or a multipage tabularx
    environment? Short lists will look better in singlepage mode, but
    obviously long lists have to be split up over multiple pages. See
    latexTemplates.cfg, sections DeliverableTable and MilestoneTable for
    details. 
    (the defaults False / True only for demonstration of the options, pick what 
    you prefer...) 

    Default:   False 

.. describe:: useMultipageMilestoneTable

    
    Default:   True 

.. describe:: useMultipageEffortTable

    Should the effort table for the entire project be typesetting across
    multiple pages? (Similar to above, see latextemplates.cfg, SEction
    effortPerTaskTable). 

    Default:   True

.. describe:: effortTableLandscape

    Turn the effort table sideways? Can be useful for large
    consortia. Details are in effortPerTaskTableShort and
    effortPerTaskTableMultipage sections of latexTemplates.cfg. 

    Default:   True 

.. index::
   single:  settings.cfg ;  CustomLaTeX

CustomLaTeX
===========
.. program::  CustomLaTeX

A section for custom LaTeX commands.  Rationale: there might be some
things you'd like to include in your proposal that are not fit for
making them general, but can be computed based on the numbers
contained in files pulled form the wiki. E.g., the toal number of
person months to this end, this section allows you to write python
code that is executed once every thing else is done and assign the
result to a LaTeX command. The defining command will end up in
settings.tex; the option name will be used as the LaTeX command, to
be replaced by the result of evaluating the python code here. In
particular, you have access to the variables described in section
:ref:`seclatexFromXML`. 

CAUTION: you can really screw up everything here. It can delete your
disk, insult for boss, and kill your pet. You are WARNED!  To make
use of this feature, you have to understand the Python code!


.. describe:: totalPM

    As an example: total person months should be defined like this. This
    command is actually used.  

    Default:   sum([int(e['resources']) for e in allEfforts])

.. describe:: tocLevel

    Set the toc level for LaTeX; easier than to manipulate the main.tex
    file. 

    Default:   3

.. describe:: secNumDepth

    How deeply should headings be numbered? 

    Default:   3
