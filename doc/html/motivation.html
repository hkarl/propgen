<h1>Why this tool?<a class="headerlink" href="#why-this-tool" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h1>
<p>Writing an application for a research project is a challenging task: good ideas are needed, background research checks, a research hypothesis and a research program have to be formulated. When applying for a larger project, this is typically done by a group of people, coming from different organizations. A lot of work goes into the creative process - the mere act of writing the proposal, collecting information about the program structure, putting it in Gantt charts and tables of deliverables etc. should get out of the way!</p>
<p>Anybody who has tried to write a proposal for one of the European Union&#8217;s Framework Programs knows that it can be a cumbersome process. The EU provides a relatively strict template which information to provide: information about work packages, tasks, deliverables, milestones, Gantt charts, etc. Much of this information is repeated at several places in the document, in various forms of presentation (tables, charts, free text). Merely keeping this information in synch can be a formidable challenge, in particular, when several people work on a proposal. To make matters worse, the EU only provides an MS Word template (and not a particularly well done one, either). There is no support to get all the administrative work out of the way.</p>
<p>This was the very situation we were in when we developed a proposal for a reasonably large EU proposal (an integrated project with about 15 partners). Instead of going down the Word-road, we decided to put all the information on a Wiki and to generate the actual proposal from there, using LaTeX to typeset the actual document and generating all the administrative information automatically. This has three main advantages:</p>
<ul class="simple">
<li>Wikis are easy to use even for novel users who are not used to using version control systems for collaborative work (let alone trying to distribute these files via email). Wikis naturally split up text in separate sections, circumventing the often problematic features of word processors to split up a document in smaller files.</li>
<li>All the administrative information only needs to be entered ONCE. All possible presentations are automatically generated. They are guaranteed to stay synchronized. There is no time wasted for such work. Even non-trivial operations can be done until late in the proposal preparation without any risk (e.g., we decided to move a deliverable around a few hours before proposal submission - that would have been impossible with conventional tools).</li>
<li>Wikis allow us to concentrate on the content, on our research ideas. We do not have to waste time fighting with a word processor.</li>
</ul>
<p>To give one example: a task description for a workpackage looks as described in the figure in a moinmoin wiki. This then gets translated automatically into a Gantt chart for the workpackage (and into a Gantt chart for the project as a whole, and in tables, and in ...).</p>
<div class="figure">
<a class="reference internal image-reference" href="_images/wikiTasks.png"><img alt="_images/wikiTasks.png" src="_images/wikiTasks.png" /></a>
<p class="caption">Example of a Wiki page, specifying several tasks for a workpackage (the architecture improvement task even has three phases).</p>
</div>
<div class="figure">
<a class="reference internal image-reference" href="_images/WPgantt.png"><img alt="_images/WPgantt.png" src="_images/WPgantt.png" /></a>
<p class="caption">Resulting Gantt chart from the example task table (deliverable and milestones shown in this Gantt chart are defined in other Wiki tables)</p>
</div>
<p>Hence, the approach to go from a wiki to latex to PDF, and to submit this PDF file, has worked out nicely. It has produced a workflow that was reasonably easy for everybody, with full version control support without less IT-savy users needing to worry about it.</p>
<p>We felt that such a tool might be beneficial for a wider audience. So here it is - feel free to use it, to modify it, and to write interesting proposals using it. Our hope is that it will free up time from the mundane and boring tasks and enable all of us to concentrate more on the creative aspects of research.</p>

<p>PS: When I write &#8220;we&#8221;, I refer to the team of colleagues engaged in the writing of said initial integrated research proposal. In particular, Bengt Ahlgren, Dirk Kutscher and Börje Ohlman deserve my thanks and gratitude for bearing through the rough-shot development of the inital version of this tool. I am indebted to them for constructive criticisms, ideas, and encouragement.</p>
