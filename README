This is the proposal generator: turn Wiki into LaTeX into PDF, uploadable as EU FP7 proposals 


Requirements: 
-------------

* make 
* python 2.7 
* latex
* a file system that supports symbolic links 
  (it should be possible to do without, but that is not tested) 


Installation:
-------------

* Read INSTALL and the documentation in the doc directory 


Directories: 
------------

* bin: all scripts necessary 
* doc: documentation - contains PDF file, html both in singlefile 
  and several directory format. Look here for details. 
* docsource: the Sphinx / restructured text sources for the documentation 
* generated: files that are directly generated from wiki; do not edit in there! 
* latex: latex files for manual editing 
  * symbolic links to generated files are in put in place automatically,
    unless a normal file is already in place

This set of script was developed while writing a proposal for an FP7
Integrated Project in Call 8. I am indebted to my colleagues who
suffered through all the bugs, hazzles and imperfections. In
particular, Bengt Ahlgren, Dirk Kutscher, Börje Ohlmann, Stephen
Farrel, Hannu Flinck, and Pasi Sarolahti provided many valuable hints,
suggestions, and requirements.
