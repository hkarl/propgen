For each participant in the proposed project, provide a brief description of the organisation, the main tasks they have been attributed, and the previous experience relevant to those tasks. Provide also a short profile of the staff members who will be undertaking the work. Maximum length for Section 2.2: one page per participant. However, where two or more departments within an organisation have quite distinct roles within the proposal, one page per department is acceptable. The maximum length applying to a legal entity composed of several members, each of which is a separate legal entity (for example an EEIG), is one page per member, provided that the members have quite distinct roles within the proposal.
