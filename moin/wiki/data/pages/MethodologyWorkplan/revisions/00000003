===== Start commission hints =====

A detailed work plan should be presented, broken down into work packages\footnote{A work package is a major sub-division of the proposed project with a verifiable end-point --- normally a deliverable or a milestone in the overall project.} (TASKs) which should follow the logical phases of the implementation of the project, and include consortium management and assessment of progress and results. (Please note that your overall approach to management will be described later, in Section 2). Please present your plans as follows:
   1. Describe the overall strategy of the work plan.
   1. Show the timing of the different TASKs and their components (Gantt chart or similar). 
   1. Provide a detailed work description broken down into work packages:
      1. work package list
      1. deliverables list
      1. list of milestones
      1. description of each work package
      1. summary effort table
   1. Provide a graphical presentation of the components showing their interdependencies (Pert diagram or similar)
   1. Describe any significant risks, and associated contingency plans
Note: The number of work packages used must be appropriate to the complexity of the work and the overall value of the proposed project. The planning should be sufficiently detailed to justify the proposed effort and allow progress monitoring by the Commission.
