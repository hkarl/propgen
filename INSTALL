Installation instructions: 

* Obtain this package from github or elsewhere 
  https://github.com/hkarl/propgen

* Install python, if necessary
  * Make sure you have python 2.7 
  * Tested on python 2.7.2 
  * The command python needs to be in the path 

* Install latex, if necessary  
  * Tested on texlive 2011, known NOT to work on older texlive installations 
  * several style files are needed that are not in the standard distro 
    or that needed modifications; they are included here. Usually, your 
    LaTeX environment should pick them up without any problems. 

* Decide which wiki to use 
  * Currently supported: twiki, moinmoin 
  * Remote access to wikis needs the pyhton module mechanize to be installed
    see here: http://wwwsearch.sourceforge.net/mechanize/
  * Local access to wikis is supported for moinmoin - MUCH faster, of course. 
    Ideal for a server-site installation! 

* Configure settings.cfg 

* If you want to customize, look at template/latexTemplates.cfg
