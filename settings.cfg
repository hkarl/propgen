# custom LaTeX commands 
# Rationale: there might be some things you'd like to include in your proposal that 
# are not fit for making in general, but can be computed based on the numbers contained in files pulled form the wiki 
# E.g., the toal number of person months 
# to this end, this section allows you to write python code that is executed once every thing else is done 
# and assign the result to a LaTeX command. The defining command will end up in settings.tex 
# the command is the option name 
# CAUTION: you can really screw up everything here. It can delete your disk and kill your pet. You are WARNED!
# To make use of this feature, you have to understand the Python code! 

[CustomLaTeX]

# e.g.: total person months should be defined like this: 

totalPM = sum([int(e['resources']) for e in allEfforts])

# and it will turn into a LaTeX command in settings.tex like this 
# (where 999 is of course replaced by the result of computing based on actual data): 
# \newcommand{totalPM}{999}
